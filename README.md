# ML-Project-On-Grammar-Checking
Though this assesment was supposed to be done using PyTorch but as I do not have proper knowlwedge of the same till the time, It was impossible for me to build the project using it. But in near future once I learn it, that I will do very soon I will use it to build models.

This project is done using TensorFlow & Keras.
Thsi is officially my first project using text data. I have only used Encoder-Decoder model here. Although we can used many other models for this task like Transformers, BERT, GPT etc.

In future, I will come up with more such models to solve different kind of tasks.
